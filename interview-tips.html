        <h1>Interview Tips</h1><br/>
        <h3>Take Notes</h3>
        <p>
            How you apply this will depend on the interview. I've had ones where they talk you through the
            problem, and others where they paste a problem and you just go for it.<br/><br/>

            If you're being described a problem without the full problem spec verbally, it's very important to
            type down some notes while they're talking. Anything of interest that you might want to follow up
            on, write it down!<br/><br/>

            If you're given the full problem, read through it thoroughly.<br/><br/>

            Next, when brainstorming your solution, you also want to write down your thought process.
            This helps both you and your interviewer stay on the same page with respect to documenting
            your thought process. Writing down pseudocode may also be a good idea, but assure your interviewer
            that it is just pseudocode and not your actual solution.<br/><br/>

            When you actually do implementation, I think it's a good idea to leave some comment nuggets at critical
            junctures in your code. Don't comment every line, but doing this to explain in English what a certain
            chunk of code is doing can make it harder to space out to the point where you have trouble
            understanding your own code.<br/><br/>
        </p>

        <h3>Test Quickly, Effectively, and Iteratively</h3>
        <p>
            In almost any interview, you'll be asked to write tests and/or walk through test cases manually.
            While this may sound simple, it's really not, and could make or break your interview.<br/><br/>

            Assume your solution is going to break. If you assume that your code works and it doesn't,
            you just end up feeling depressed, even shocked, which is not great for an interview. This means
            you should start with the simplest, easiest test cases. These should go fairly quickly as you hit
            an early base case or what not, but the point is to catch small mistakes.<br/><br/>

            From there, you can try one or two more challenging test cases and see if the interviewer is
            satisfied. Generally speaking the interviewer is able to spot issues with your code while
            you're writing it, so they will hint to you whether your solution is acceptable or not.<br/><br/>

        <h3>Be humble first, confident second</h3>
        <p>
            At first glance, being humble and confident might seem contradictory, and to a degree they are.
            Learning to tow the line between the two so you come off as smart but also a nice person to work
            with is important.<br/><br/>

            If you had to choose between the two, definitely err on the side of humbleness. All else equal,
            companies will always hire the nice unconfident person over the toxic know-it-all. With that said,
            strive for a balance. Respect your interviewer, their thoughts and opinions, and it's okay to
            say "I don't know".<br/><br/>

            Confidence, on the other hand, is being able to clearly articulate the decisions you make
            throughout the interview and why you are choosing them.<br/><br/>

            Don't just say, "I'll use a hash map", explain that you want to take advantage of the O(1)
            access as compared to O(n) from an array.<br/><br/>

            Don't just say, "I'll start with the basic test case", explain that you like to catch smaller
            mistakes earlier on as a testing strategy.<br/><br/>

            This extra information gives your interviewer a lot of additional context that they can use
            to understand the depth of your knowledge.<br/><br/>
